Theoretical Question Answers:

12 In XV6, a process can be in one of three states: Running, Sleeping, or Runnable.

13 The file system in XV6 includes Inodes, Data blocks, Directory entries, and a Superblock.

14 System calls provide an interface to the operating system kernel, while library functions are higher-level functions provided by libraries. Example: fork() as a system call for process creation and printf() as a library function for formatted output.

15 XV6 uses paging for memory management, providing benefits like efficient memory use and easier management.

16 Essential shell commands in XV6 include ls (list directory contents), cd (change the current directory), and cp (copy files or directories).

17 Process synchronization in XV6 ensures orderly execution using mechanisms like locks and semaphores to coordinate access to shared resources.

18 Interrupts in XV6 are handled using hardware interrupts, essential for responding to external events and maintaining system responsiveness.

19 Virtual memory in XV6 is implemented through paging, allowing processes to use more memory than physically available, providing isolation and efficient memory usage.

20 The boot process of XV6 involves BIOS initializing, bootloading the kernel, kernel initialization, initiation of the first user-space process, and the start of user interaction with the shell.
